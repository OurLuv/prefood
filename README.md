## Project Description
I have developed a REST API monolith using the Golang for my little pet project. With this API, you can easily manage data in your food ordering application. 

My Golang development serves as the foundation for next projects in food ordering. While it is just a pet project, the API ensures reliability and efficiency required for the smooth operation of your application.


## Used Technologies 
- Gorilla Mux - An URL router and dispatcher for creating flexible and efficient routes in your Golang application.
- Pgxpool - A PostgreSQL connection pool library for Golang, allowing management and utilization of database connections.
- Docker with Postgres Image - Docker provides containerization for your application and using a Postgres image allows for setup and management of your database environment.
- Golang JWT - A library for generating JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and handling authentication in the application.
- Gomock - A mocking framework for Golang for generating mock objects for unit testing, enabling easier and more effective testing of your code.
